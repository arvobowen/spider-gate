## üéØ About The Project

**SpiderGate** is a lightweight, extensible Node.js server designed to act as a central gateway for various API-driven automations. Instead of deploying multiple standalone services, SpiderGate provides a core foundation that can dynamically load independent modules, which we call **"orbs."**

This architecture simplifies deployment, centralizes configuration, and allows for clean, compartmentalized development of individual API functionalities.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Modular Architecture:** Easily add new API endpoints by creating self-contained "orbs."
* **Centralized Server:** A single, stable entry point for all your API traffic.
* **Static Landing Page:** A professional landing page to represent the server's status.
* **Scalable:** Designed to grow with your needs, from one orb to many.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

SpiderGate is designed with a core and plugin architecture.

* **The Gateway (`spider-gate`):** This is the core project. Its only job is to start the web server, serve the landing page, and load any available orbs.
* **The Orbs (e.g., `sg-announcer-gt`):** These are separate, self-contained Node.js projects that export an Express Router. Each orb defines its own API endpoints and logic. The gateway dynamically mounts these routers at their specified paths.

This keeps each piece of functionality completely decoupled and easy to maintain.
